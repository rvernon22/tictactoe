# tictactoe
First attempt at a 3D interfaced tictactoe game using java swing
The project is just source code so to get it running plug it in any java IDE and it should run just fine.
The enitre project is complete as it was just getting the tictactoe functions working, along with a few exta features such as a you win screen, highlighting the squares that won the match and which player won.
